===== only intro about the course can skip ======


This course will give you the knowledge, skills, and the confidence to pass the OCI foundations exam, and beyond that, give you the foundational knowledge needed for OCI projects. The course will cover all the areas of the OCI Foundations exam. We will start with a quick introduction of the OCI platform. And then we will dive deep into the code primitives, compute, storage, networking, identity, databases, security, and more.

And last but not the least, I will discuss our differentiated pricing, SLA, and support options. Throughout the course, I will be using fun analogies to explain complex topics and leverage visual slides to help you better retain information. There is a skills check at the end of every module so you can validate your knowledge and gain the confidence to pass the exam.

And finally, we understand you're busy. So most of our course lessons are less than five minutes long. Our goal is to help you retain information and keep you engaged. I hope you're as excited as I am to start this course. Thanks for enrolling. Let's begin.
